The Document object in JavaScript represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window. It provides methods and properties to access and manipulate the document's structure, elements, and content. Developers commonly use the Document object to dynamically update the page, handle events, and modify the document's appearance in response to user interactions or other events.

On the other hand, the Window object encapsulates the browser window or tab itself. It represents the entire browser environment and provides access to functionalities such as timing events, browser history, and the global scope for JavaScript code execution. Developers leverage the Window object to interact with the broader browser environment beyond the confines of the document, enabling tasks like controlling popup windows, managing browser navigation, and handling user interactions at the window level.
